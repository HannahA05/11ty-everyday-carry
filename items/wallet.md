{% itemCard "Wallet", "/images/wallet.jpeg", "I always carry my wallet with me because it has everything I need when I’m out like my ID, cards, car keys, and a little cash. It’s small and lightweight, so it doesn’t take up much room in my bag, and I can just grab it and go. I also have an AirTag attached, just in case I ever lose it." %}
